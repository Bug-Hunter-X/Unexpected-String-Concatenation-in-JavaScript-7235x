This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug stemming from the language's loose typing system. Specifically, the '+' operator's behavior when used with a mix of numbers and strings can lead to unexpected results. The bug.js file shows the problematic code, while bugSolution.js presents the solution using explicit type checking or conversion.
